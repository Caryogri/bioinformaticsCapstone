# Bioinformatics Capstone Code

Contains code I wrote for the Bioinformatics Capstone Class (BIO 465) at BYU. The purpose of the class was to work in groups performing bioinformatics research for a sponsor. My group's sponsor was a company called Geneial. My responsibilites were to create a script to scrape data from ClinGen's database which - at the time - did not appear to have a functioning API. Geneial needed the information in FASTA format and the script I wrote pulled the information from ClinGen's database and formatted it for use in their AWS pipeline.

I was also responsible for generating one of our quantitative figures for our research paper. To do this, I used Bash commands to organize to organize larger data which could not be directly processed in R Studio and used R to create the actual scripts.
